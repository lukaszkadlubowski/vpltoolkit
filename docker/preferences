### my preferences ###

# first, always prefer testing on stable (higher score)
# then use unstable only as backup, if no testing/stable package exists...

# 1) to install the package with highest pinning score
# apt-get install <package>

# 2) to install the unstable version of the package, and try to meet any dependencies normally from testing & stable... this may not work!
# apt-get install <package>/unstable

# 3) install the unstable version of the package, and try to meet any dependencies from unstable... this may produce better results!
# apt-get -t unstable install <package>
